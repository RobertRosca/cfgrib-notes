    "## Named Array Backend\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary based on [Exploring Julia xarray equivalents](./191208-00-julia-xarrays-like.ipynb) notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are currently around five options in Julia for creating n-dimensional arrays with named axis:\n",
    "\n",
    " - [AxisArrays](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/AxisArrays.jl)\n",
    " - [NamedArrays](https://github.com/davidavdav/NamedArrays.jl)\n",
    " - [NamedDims.jl](https://github.com/invenia/NamedDims.jl)\n",
    " - [DimensionalData.jl](https://github.com/rafaqz/DimensionalData.jl)\n",
    " - [ITensors.jl](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensors.jl)\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of those, both DimensionalData and ITensors explicitly stated that they are preview releases/very early in development and that the interfaces will continue to change. This is an inevitable problem in Julia as the language itself is very young and the ecosystem has yet to settle on standard packages in the same way that Python has.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining options were AxisArrays, NamedArrays, and NamedDims. The main benefits Julia has over Python is performance and the focus on multiple dispatch, these both require type-stable data that the compiler can easily deal with and interpret, NamedArrays does not allow for this when doing axis lookups so (even though it is in the top for popularity) I decided to rule it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "NamedDims does what it says on the tin and lets you name the dimensions - without associated coordinate values, so it was ruled out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which leaves AxisArrays. However, as mentioned in accompanying notebook, there are extensive discussion about implementing large changes to AxisArrays in the future due to some limitations caused by the current architecture of the package. These changes should end up being mostly internal, meaning that packages depending on AxisArrays should not have to change much (if at all) to be compatible with future versions. The discussions are spread across these issues on GitHub: [AxisArrays Roadmap](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/AxisArrays.jl/issues/7), [AxisArrays Issue: Use value indexing by default](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/AxisArrays.jl/issues/84), [AxisArraysFuture Plan](https://github.com/JuliaCollections/AxisArraysFuture/issues/1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given those discussions, I had another look at DimensionalData (which explicitly mentions that it is under active development and unstable) and it is also a very nice option, as it is effectively a much newer 'cleaner' version of AxisArrays. Its implementation allows for much easier extensibility and abstraction, the syntax is more user-friendly and slightly less verbose, and finally it appears to solve the problems AxisArrays has encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end stability will be a problem with any choice in an ecosystem which has not settled down on standard packages. As an indication of how much movement is planned, here is a [comment from a discussion](https://github.com/JuliaCollections/AxisArraysFuture/issues/1#issuecomment-484702271) about the future of many of these packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "> > I just started looking through the NamedDims repo, so I apologize if this is already documented but I missed it. Is NamedDims ultimately intended to be integrated into AxisArrays or is it suppose to be a dependency or something else entirely?\n",
    ">\n",
    "> NamedDims.jl is intended to:\n",
    ">   A) Be used on its own,\n",
    ">   B) Be integrated into a future package along with IndexedDims.jl (name pending, Indexes.jl?), and that future package will replace AxisArrays.jl. (Like how StaticArrays.jl, replaced FixedSizedArrays.jl)\n",
    "\n",
    "My honest view is that this space will change massively over the next few years, so no current choice will survive for long. There are a lot of very new, very early-development packages like [AbstractIndecies](https://github.com/Tokazama/AbstractIndices.jl) or [IndexedDims](https://github.com/invenia/IndexedDims.jl), [AcceleratedArrays](https://github.com/andyferris/AcceleratedArrays.jl), and more, which have the potential to completely change the ecosystem in the future depending on their success.\n",
    "\n",
    "A caveat to this is that even if things do change that should not be too big of a problem. Unlike Python, Julia has an excellent built-in package manager which handles version dependencies and concretisation beautifully, meaning large deprecations should not be a problem as you will always know what versions your package depends on and you can install all of these in a separate environment very easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other bonus is that all of these packages are relatively simple wrappers around the base Julia implementation of arrays, meaning that they are all on the order of 1-2 thousand lines of code, whereas xarray is on the order of tens of thousands of lines (core being ~28k). This isn't the best measure of complexity, but such a huge difference does indicate a big difference in the amount of effort and knowledge required to maintain these packages, which is a good sign for the long-term health of the ecosystem (at least once it has had a chance to settle down).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, there's no easy way to pick the best option or to say what will be used in a year or two. But, at least for now, AxisArrays has the most good points:\n",
    "\n",
    " - It has a larg set of contributors, and more use in the community\n",
    " - The interface is quite similar `xarrays`\n",
    " - It allows for \"type-stable selection of dimensions and compile-time axis lookup\", which lets the compiler to keep the code performant\n",
    " - Already has integration with other packages, e.g. `SimpleTraits.jl`\n",
    " - Implementation with a metadata layer exists in `ImageMetadata.jl` - required for xarray-like attributes"

It also provides a convenient `Index` type which can be used to filter the messages so that you only load data you are interested in.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Array Backend\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, [AxisArrays](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/AxisArrays.jl) was chosen as the Julia xarray equivalent, although how the ecosystem will evolve in the future is not clear so the Julia implementation will be developed with that in mind and will make it as easy as possible to swap out the array backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few features will need to be added on top of AxisArrays to achieve the same functionality as xarray:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `DataSet` (multiple `DataArrays`) support:\n",
    "    - Currently AxisArrays only store one set of data - equivalent to a `DataArray` in xarray\n",
    "    - xarray has the notion of a `DataSet`, which is a group of multiple `DataArray`s with common coordinates\n",
    "    - This does not exist in AxisArrays but is quite easy to add in with a wrapper\n",
    " - Metadata (`attrs`) support\n",
    "    - Can be achieved with a simple wrapper function, or could be done via integration with `ImageMetadata.jl`\n",
    " - Non-dimension coordinate support\n",
    "    - xarray can store coordinates used for auxiliary labeling, e.g. the `step` and `valid_time` coordinates\n",
    "    - This does not exist, but can be added in with a wrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these are features which should exist (and already might as I have not used AxisArrays that much, and the documentation is not extremely thorough) already, so my plan would be to first develop them working on this project, and then to request to merge them into AxisArrays. This would help build the community more, and also help with long-term code stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### cfgrib Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling the ecCodes is easy to do through Julia as C can be called directly, however I would prefer to integrate with and support existing packages where possible, so I would start off by building on top of the existing GRIB package in Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "This package is (as per their readme) \"an interface to the ECMWF ecCodes library\", where \"a GribFile functions similarly to a Julia IOStream, except that instead of working as a stream of bytes, GribFile works as a stream of messages.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "GRIB.jl already supports the concept of an `Index` type, which can be used to filter the messages so that you only receive the data you are interested in - this is similar to the heterogeneous filtering cfgrib can perform with the `backend_kwargs={'filter_by_keys': {'typeOfLevel': 'surface'}}` arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another feature of cfgrib which needs supported is the notion of coordinate transformations, which I have not looked at much, but from what I understood of the cfgrib documentation there won't be any problems implementing similar functionality in Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "My proposed plan starting in January is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get some examples of moderately complex real-life uses of cfgrib, along with the required data, which use all of the features of cfgrib. I would use these examples to create some tests, which would be the starting point of the development of the Julia package.\n",
    "2. Work on the ecCodes calls, either via `GRIB.jl` or with a new implementation from scratch, get this to a functional level where the files can be read in as standard Julia arrays and dictionaries\n",
    "3. Work on the wrapper for AxisArrays, adding in support for:\n",
    "    1. `DataSet`s - multiple collections of `AxisArray`s\n",
    "    2. Metadata - dictionary attached to a ArraySet/AxisArray, like `attrs` for xarray\n",
    "    3. Non-dimensional coordinates\n",
    "4. Test development done in parallel to each of the above stages\n",
    "    1. Finalise unit tests\n",
    "    2. Finalise integration tests and example tests\n",
    "5. Potential tests which use `PyCall` to compare the results between Julia and Python\n",
    "6. If possible, merge some code back into AxisArrays.jl and GRIB.jl\n",
    "7. Nice to have features/integrations:\n",
    "    1. `SimpleTraits`\n",
    "    2. `FileIO`\n",
    "    3. `JuliaDB`-like distributed multiprocessing\n"
