    "    Deliverable 1 (by 30. December latest, would be better earlier â€“ we need a deliverable this year): A plan for implementation;  A feasibility study, based on existing solutions in the Julie eco system. cfGrib for Python is successful because we started from the Python solution, like xarray, and mapped GRIb onto it. A set of mockup Julia notebook to see how future programs will look like working with GRIB data\n",

    "\n",
    " - Read grib as xarray\n",
    "     - All standard xarray features work - may be a problem if Julia-equivalent to xarray is missing crucial functionality\n",
    "     - Integration with dask\n",
    "     - \"cfgrib reads a limited set of ecCodes recognised keys from the GRIB files\"\n",
    " - Data model translation via cf2cdm\n",
    "     - Dictionary of user-defined translations of CF compliant coordinates\n",
    "     - Translations cover:\n",
    "         - name: `depthKelowLand` -> `level`\n",
    "         - units: `undefined` -> `m`\n",
    "         - direction: `undefined` -> `increasing`\n",
    " - Filter heterogeneous GRIB files\n",
    "     - If file contains multiple `typeOfLevel` an error `ValueError: multiple values for unique key` is raised as the values are ambiguous\n",
    "     - If different variables (`t` and `z`) share a coordinate and the coordinates are not identical an error `ValueError: key present and new value is different` is raised"

    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    " - xarray GRIB engine allows for Dask integration. If similar functionality is desired in Julia then Dagger.jl  / JuliaDB integration would be required.\n",
    " - Last I checked, AxisArrays.jl is the best xarray equivalent in Julia, however there are plans to [overhaul it in the future](https://github.com/JuliaCollections/AxisArraysFuture/issues/1) - this is an inherent risk of using a young language, package stability is a long ways off as there are no real established standard packages yet\n",
    " - Small typo in cfgrib readme, 'Translate to a custom data model' says \"cf2cfm\" instead of \"cf2cdm\"\n",
    " - Translation via `cf2cdm` can sort coordinate in ascending/descending order\n",
    " - Some tests are performed via [cdsapi](https://github.com/ecmwf/cdsapi) calls - how should this be handled?\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A GRIB stream, a file, is list of GRIB messages\n",
    "    - A GRIB message contains a single geographic field with latitude, longitude\n",
    "    - Message metadata (keys) can be regarded as additional coordinates: time, level, etc.\n",
    "    - MARS retrievals are typically nice hypercubes\n",
    "    - Messages in a stream are completely independent, there's no guarantee\n"
